English Verb Conjugation Practice App

This web app helps ESL students practice and improve their English verb conjugation skills by providing random conjugation exercises in various tenses. It allows students to practice verbs in different grammatical forms, enhancing their understanding and fluency in verb usage.

Features:

Multiple Tenses: Practice conjugations in the following tenses:
Present Simple

Interactive Feedback: Instant feedback is provided on your answers, telling you if your response is correct or incorrect. The correct answer is displayed if you're wrong.
Mobile-Friendly: The user interface is optimized for mobile with a clean, responsive layout and large buttons for easy interaction.
Case-Insensitive Answer Checking: The app ignores case sensitivity when checking your answers, allowing you to focus on verb conjugation rather than capitalization.

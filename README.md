Verb Drills App
The Verb Drills App is a web-based tool designed to help ESL (English as a Second Language) students practice and improve their English verb conjugation skills. By providing randomized conjugation exercises across various tenses, the app helps users enhance their understanding and fluency in verb usage.

Correct answers are displayed if the user's response is incorrect.
Feedback includes animations (e.g., shake effect for incorrect answers) for better engagement.
3. Randomized Questions
Each question is generated with a random subject, verb, and tense.
Users can enable or disable specific tenses or opt for random tense selection.
4. Accessibility
Fully keyboard-accessible with visible focus indicators.
Screen reader support with aria-live regions for dynamic feedback.
Font toggle feature to switch between Roboto and OpenDyslexic for dyslexia-friendly usage.
5. Mobile-Friendly
